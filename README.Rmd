## Installation

You can install the released version of read.cwa from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r example}
library(read.cwa)
file = system.file("extdata", "ax3_testfile.cwa.gz", package = "read.cwa")
out = read_cwa(file)
head(out)
```

```{r ex2}
